GENNY VST beta - Landon Podbielski
----------------------------------------------------------
Notes
======
This is a BETA! That means its got bugs, some features don't actually work, rude
stuff like that. I tried to get it to an almost completely usable state, but there
is obviously stuff that needs work. Use at your own risk, obviously it's not gonna
blow up your computer but it might mess up one of your projects or screw
up your instrument sounds if you push it the right way. I've tested it extensively
and haven't run into anything like this, but keep it in mind. 

Install Instructions
=====================
Just put Gennybeta.dll into your VST Plugins folder ("Program Files(x86)\VstPlugins" probably).
To install the FL Studio version, just run install.bat

Midi Automation
================
COMING SOON!


Usage Notes
============
I'm working on a page to explain it right now, until then just ask if you have any questions!
If you want to add your own drums, set them up like the Fancy Drums example included and the folder 
next to GennyPresetPackager.exe, then run it. It will make a .dpack file that you can load from the 
import tab. Look at drumMap.txt to see a list of all the map names and note numbers.


Thanks
============================
Well, I created the VST, but there are some other people who played (incredibly) important parts in its existence.
 
hiro-shi / Jarek Burczynski / Eke-Eke - Wrote Genesis Plus GX 2612 implementation which I use.
The Eighth Bit - Created The Ultimate Megadrive Soundfont, which I use a lot and which helped inspire this VST.
Sam - Created VOPM, an excellent YM2151 plugin that also helped inspire me. 
Yamaha - For creating the YM chips and popularizing FM Synthesis in the first place. (shoutout to John Chowning)
spritesmind.net - An awesome Mega Drive / etc development forum filled with incredibly helpful people. 
Tiido Priimägi - was very patient with my lack of knowledge and was my go-to guy for YM2612 questions.

Howard Drossin, John Baker, Tommy Tallarico, Matt Furniss, Masato Nakamura, Masaru Setsumaru, Yuzo Koshiro, Jredd etc -
made awesome Genesis music, are awesome composers, and are all around major influences on my life.
