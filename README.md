# GENNY 
Sega Genesis/Megadrive YM2612/SN76486 Emulation in the form of a VST/FL Plugin!

I'm new to the whole public repository thing so if I'm doing anything wrong or ridiculous please let me know!

This plugin would not be possible without code from the following repositories: 

https://github.com/AidanHockey5/MegaMIDI - MegaMIDI support

https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX - YM2612 and SN76489 Emulation Adapted from Genesis Plus GX

https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vstgui - GUI uses Steinberg's VSTGUI Engine

Shout out to Aly James for FMDrive, we happened to independently develop seperate YM2612 VST's at the same time.
He was kind enough to reach out to me, and he helped out with a number of chip related questions that helped me to finish GENNY.

Howard Drossin, John Baker, Matt Furniss, Masato Nakamura, Masaru Setsumaru, Yuzo Koshiro, Jredd, etc all made awesome Genesis music, are awesome composers, and are all around major influences on my life.
